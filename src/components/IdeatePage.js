            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              After we finalized our concept the next important step was to use
              the MosCow method to streamline and pinpoint the essential
              features of our app. This helped us to to identify the must-have,
              should-have, could-have, and won't-have features of our
              application. I played a crucial role here as it can be seen in the
              embedded FigJam file because the inputs I provided in the fields
              ultimately influenced features of our app.
            </p>
            <h2>Question</h2>
            <p>What insights are valuable to teachers?</p>
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p onClick={openMoscow} className="method">
              MoSCoW
            </p>
            <h2>Why</h2>

            <p>
              The MoSCoW method helped us prioritize the features and
              requirements based on their importance. By using this method we
              identified the must-have features that are most important for
              providing insights into high sound levels, such as real-time
              alerts and safe space suggestions. It allowed us to focus on
              delivering the most important functionalities first by ensuring
              that we will effectively address the primary needs of our target
              users.
            </p>

            <h2>How</h2>

            <p>
              This was a group activity and each team member contributed with
              this own ideas by placing sticky notes in the categorized columns.
              I added my ideas to the MosCow table. After that we discussed our
              ideas and we collectively created our final MosCow prioritization.
            </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
              The results from the MosCow prioritization showcased that our app
              will prioritize on having simple and easy to read interface,
              real-time decibel measurement feature, customisable threshold
              feature. Additional features like safe space suggestions and peak
              noise alerts. Showcasing complex visuals and detailed graphs of
              data wonâ€™t be a priority.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              The results we gained via the MosCow method provided us with
              valuable clarity on the required screens for our app and enabled
              us to refine the user flows and subsequently create a cohesive and
              intuitive user experience.

              Navigation Map
            </p>
            <h2>Why</h2>

            <p>
              This process was a crucial step in the design process of our app
              because we gained a deeper understanding of the journey and
              interactions of users within the application by visually mapping
              out the paths they will take. The user flow diagram served as a
              blueprint for the structure and functionality of our app.
            </p>

            <h2>How</h2>

            <p>
              This was a group activity and everyone contributed by sharing
              ideas. We did it in couple of iterations. Based on the competitor
              analysis I did previously I knew that most apps had the real -
              time noise measuring meter on the home / dashboard screen. Based
              on that I proposed my colleagues to incorporate that as a starting
              point for our flow. Then from the MosCow analysis we also knew
              that there would be a screen showing directions for space safes as
              well as a screen for showing the daily dosage of sound levels.
              Based on the research from the competitive analysis we came up
              with a dosimeter screen. This decision was influenced by DecibelX
              & db Meter apps which had a dosimeter showing percentage values of
              sound dose levels. Finally in our 3rd iteration the Dosimeter
              screen was renamed into Daily dose and the screen called Live
              Dosimeter Metrics was renamed to Exposure limit and was placed as
              screen next to Daily dose instead of being nested in order to
              avoid user confusion.
            </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The end result with all iterations can be seen on the side.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              After the user flow diagram was finalised we had a clear picture
              of how users will interact with our app. With this marked as done
              we were ready to proceed into the next activity in our process.

            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              After we completed the user flows which was a crucial step in
              understanding the journey and interactions of our users within our
              app, we then proceeded to the next activity in our process:
              creating UI moodboards. The mood boards served as visual
              inspiration and as a reference point for the overall look and feel
              our app. Each one of us created his own moodboard and shared it
              with the others for feedback.

              Mood Board
            </p>
            <h2>Why</h2>

            <p>
              UI moodboards were relevant to our project because they served as
              visual reference that helped us explore different design styles,
              colour palettes and visual elements. By creating them we were able
              to gather inspiration and establish a visual direction for our
              app. The UI moodboards were the visual guides which allowed us to
              effectively communicate and align our design ideas.
            </p>

            <h2>How</h2>

            <p>
              To create my moodboard I searched for inspirations at{" "}
              <span className="method" onClick={openDribble}>
                Dribbble.com.
              </span>{" "}
              I was looking for examples with darker background colour and
              brighter colours on visual elements. My idea was to gather ideas
              with modern and fresh looks. I found an interesting smart watch
              interface design example that captured my attention, because it
              conveyed what I was looking for. I put all the parts together in
              order to create my moodboard.
            </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
              You can see the result on the right side where my moodboard is
              showed.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              The moodboard gave me a significant idea of â€‹â€‹what our interface
              could look like with certain bright colors and a dark background.
              Subsequently in later stages when my colleagues and I were
              choosing the color palette for our design system, they also voted
              for a palette of similar colors. The moodboard also influenced my
              sketches below.

            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              After gathering some inspirations from the UI moodboards it was
              time to showcase our creativity by sketching. This was a fun and
              exciting process which resulted in having a nice low-level picture
              of our future designs.

              Secondary method: Ideation
            </p>
            <h2>Why</h2>

            <p>
              We used this method to ideate and communicate our design ideas
              effectively. Sketching allowed us to explore our ideas, gather
              feedback and make informed decisions before we advance to the next
              phase.
            </p>

            <h2>How</h2>

            <p>
              We did this altogether in FigJam by sketching our ideas. I
              sketched my ideas on how certain screens might look like being
              also influenced from the moodboard I created above. We validated
              our drawn sketches by having discussions. At the end we placed our
              sketches next to the screens from our user flow diagram in order
              to have them categorised and sorted.
            </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
              My creative mind allowed me to produce sketches depicting how
              certain screens within Settings and Dosage Timeline might look
              like. The 8 sketches shown on the top are my individual
              contribution. My colleagues Majid and Oliver later on used my
              ideas to produce high - fidelity versions on the Dosage Timeline
              screen where they showed the dosage metrics with bar charts. I
              used the rest of the sketches which I created as a foundation for
              the low and high-fidelity versions of the screens I created within
              Settings during the prototyping phase.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              To conclude we had an enjoyable sketching session which was also a
              crucial step in our journey. My creative mind allowed me to
              generate some sketches which depicted the envisioned screens
              within the Settings and Dosage Timeline sections. These sketches
              served as a foundation for the future high-fidelity versions of
              those screens.
