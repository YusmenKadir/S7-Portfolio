          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            During my participation in an international project, I collaborated
            with students from diverse backgrounds and countries. Together, we
            faced a fascinating challenge that required us to develop an
            interactive solution. Our task involved creating a tool that would
            encourage students to share their unique perspectives on the core
            values of the LOT communityâ€”a community being developed by Vestide
            as part of the construction of 735 student apartments on the TU/e
            campus, set to be completed in July 2024. Our objective was to
            devise an innovative approach that would stimulate students to
            contribute their ideas and interpretations of the core values,
            fostering a sense of ownership and collaboration in shaping the
            future of the new student housing. As we worked on this project, we
            aimed to design a visually captivating and engaging tool that would
            be prominently displayed at the TUE campus, serving as a platform
            where students could express their thoughts in a manner that
            inspires and resonates with others.

            <p>
              Before stepping into prototyping the mobile app itself we created
              a moodboard seen on the left side. This moodboard contains some
              inspirational designs that we implemented into the prototype. I
              created all of the avatar visuals using an AI tool. Beside that I
              also designed the main poster and the secondary poster that might
              be put on location to attract the attention of the passing
              students.Overall, the moodboard was an invaluable tool that not
              only inspired us but also guided our creative decisions as we
              progressed towards developing an interactive solution. It provided
              a tangible and visually captivating foundation for our prototyping
              efforts, helping us stay focused on the intended user experience
              while incorporating the AI-generated avatar visuals as an
              innovative element within the design.

              Move the containers to a more accessible place, such as close to
              the TU/e build or existing student houses.

              Long-term Engagement: the online platform or community forum where
              students can continue to contribute their ideas and engage in
              discussions beyond the initial event. The platform can serve as a
              hub for ongoing community-building efforts, and make
              announcements, where students can propose initiatives, share
              resources, and collaborate with one another.

              Gamification Elements: Incorporating gamification elements into
              the experience to increase interactivity and motivation. For
              example, introducing a point system or rewards for active
              participation, such as earning badges or unlocking virtual
              achievements which translates to physical rewards. This can
              further incentivize students to engage and stay involved.

              Co-creation Opportunities: Providing opportunities for students to
              contribute to the physical space of the apartment complex
              actively. For instance, you could organize workshops or design
              competitions where students can submit ideas for communal areas,
              artwork, or other elements that reflect the community's values.
              This fosters a sense of ownership and pride among the students.

              Alumni Engagement: Extend the involvement beyond current students
              by inviting alumni to participate and share their insights. Alumni
              can provide valuable perspectives and experiences, and their
              engagement can help bridge the gap between current and past
              community members.

              Regular Feedback Channels: Establish a system for collecting
              ongoing feedback from students about their experiences in the
              community. This could be through periodic surveys, suggestion
              boxes, or digital feedback forms. Regularly reviewing and acting
              upon this feedback demonstrates a commitment to continuous
              improvement and ensures the community remains responsive to
              evolving needs.

              Collaborations with Campus Organizations: Forge partnerships with
              various campus organizations, clubs, or academic departments to
              create synergies and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. This
              can lead to joint initiatives, shared resources, and a more
              integrated community experience.

              Expansion to Online Platforms: In addition to the physical
              installation, explore ways to extend the experience to online
              platforms, such as virtual reality (VR) or interactive web
              portals. This allows for broader accessibility, remote
              participation, and the inclusion of off-campus students or alumni.

              During this project I was faced with the opportunity to work with
              colleagues of different nationalities and skills. The project gave
              me the opportunity to think bigger and in perspective. I was able
              to provide products to support my learning goals. Every prototype
              I create improves my prototyping skills, so working with my
              colleague Wolf on the mobile prototype really helped me achieve
              that. Also, this project helped me work on my soft skills such as
              communication and leadership. From the beginning of the project to
              the end, I tried to be proactive and help my other colleagues to
              open up and share their ideas. The little time we had for work, on
              the other hand, helped me develop a valuable skill, which is being
              able to handle difficult tasks in a relatively short time. I think
              this is a very important skill for the workplace I will be in the
              coming years. Overall, this project was a good experience and I'm
              glad I had the opportunity to be a part of it.
